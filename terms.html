                performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained
                in this agreement is in derogation of Ashwini Lab's right to comply with governmental, court and

                provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches
                the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.

                Lab with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
                electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating
